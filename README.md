#### Abstract
  This study was aligned with intelligent waste management systems and leverages deep 
learning technology to address persistent environmental issues, particularly the improper 
disposal of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. Rooted in gaps involving limited 
material classification, lack of incentivization, and insufficient recycling infrastructure, this 
research developed a Reverse Vending Machine (RVM) equipped with a deep learning
based material detection system and an automated cat food reward mechanism. The system 
aimed to detect and classify plastic waste, identify liquid contamination, and encourage 
user participation through tangible incentives. The methodology followed a prototyping 
approach, encompassing system design, hardware integration (camera modules, load cells, 
servo motors, GSM), software development (deep learning model), functional testing, and 
ISO 25010 compliant evaluation. The anticipated outcome was a cost-effective, scalable, 
and community-friendly recycling machine that promotes responsible consumption and 
production behaviors. Primary beneficiaries include local communities, LGUs, and pet 
welfare organizations. This study aligned with the Technological University of the 
Philippines (TUP) innovation agenda Department of Science and Technology (DOST) 
priorities and directly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #12: 
Responsible Consumption and Production. It demonstrated how intelligent systems can 
enhance environmental sustainability while fostering community engagement.
